# meterReader
This is an program intended to make month end gas, water, and utility meter readings easier to manage by storing previous readings, and performing calculations. The program is intended to be easy to use for operators and maintenance personnel.

This Program is currently in the making, the end result should be a simple user interface that uses python code to perform calculations, store data, manipulate files, add new meters, and remove meters. This README file will be updated as further progress is made.
